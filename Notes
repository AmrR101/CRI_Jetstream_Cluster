* we will start with a vanilla cluster of node-sized VMs plus 1 head node.
* The cluster will run Torque - use the XNIT
* The cluster will have a common file system - NFS for now,  until we can shrae vol's or something
* Cluster will initially run Quantum Espresso, NWChem, maybe Yambo.  Sudhakar will install these.
* The gateway group will bring the users, make sure things work with Airavata.
* Eric and Barb will use the Puppet + Ansible approach for setting up the cluster.
* MPI needs to work across nodes.
* Discuss with Mike, Jeremy, George at the beginning to make sure we are doing sensible things, not duplicating work, etc.
* We need to confirm that CPU utilization is the metric that needs to improve.
* We think that the system will be in place by September 1 for testing by SEAGrid, and that we can be at full utilization by October 15.

SSH Keys:
already added by jetstream creation process
just need to point to the right private key for ansible
 - only on the master machine!
use a .config file? - talk to Jeremy & Co. about this

MPI/Compilers
I don't think we have Intel compilers... blergh.
(no response, anyway...)
