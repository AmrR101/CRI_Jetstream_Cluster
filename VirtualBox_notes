Seagrid comp*:
 CentOS minimal
 2 nic:
  1 NAT (for now; ideally would all be private, but delaying setup of 
         yum tunneling for now...)
  1 host-only - static ip starting from 101

have to do network setup by hand for now...
 seems to be a problem with centos? :(
 should get some vagrant/cobbler/ansible/virtualbox magic to fix this
